Case name: IEEE37/IEEE_37node.
Fault section: 41 - 5 (in original topology), 14 - 5 (in simplified topology)
Fault section: node704s - node704 (using node names of .glm file)
"Fault" switch: SS_704 (using switch name of .glm file)
Full restoration is successful.
The optimal switching sequence is as follows. 
Open: 41 - 5 (in original topology), 14 - 5 (in simplified topology)
