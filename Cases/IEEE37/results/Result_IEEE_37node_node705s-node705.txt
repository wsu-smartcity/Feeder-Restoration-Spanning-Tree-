Case name: IEEE37/IEEE_37node.
Fault section: 42 - 6 (in original topology), 3 - 6 (in simplified topology)
Fault section: node705s - node705 (using node names of .glm file)
"Fault" switch: SS_705 (using switch name of .glm file)
Full restoration is successful.
The optimal switching sequence is as follows.
