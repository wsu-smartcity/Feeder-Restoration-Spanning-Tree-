Case name: IEEE37/IEEE_37node.
Fault section: 44 - 8 (in original topology), 17 - 8 (in simplified topology)
Fault section: node707s - node707 (using node names of .glm file)
"Fault" switch: SS_707 (using switch name of .glm file)
Full restoration is successful.
The optimal switching sequence is as follows. 
Open: 44 - 8 (in original topology), 17 - 8 (in simplified topology)
