Case name: IEEE37/IEEE_37node.
Fault section: 47 - 11 (in original topology), 28 - 11 (in simplified topology)
Fault section: node710s - node710 (using node names of .glm file)
"Fault" switch: SS_710 (using switch name of .glm file)
Full restoration is successful.
The optimal switching sequence is as follows. 
Open: 47 - 11 (in original topology), 28 - 11 (in simplified topology)
