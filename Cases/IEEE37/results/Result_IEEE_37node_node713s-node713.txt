Case name: IEEE37/IEEE_37node.
Fault section: 50 - 14 (in original topology), 3 - 14 (in simplified topology)
Fault section: node713s - node713 (using node names of .glm file)
"Fault" switch: SS_713 (using switch name of .glm file)
Full restoration is successful.
The optimal switching sequence is as follows. 
Open: 50 - 14 (in original topology), 3 - 14 (in simplified topology)
Open: node713s - node713 (using node names of .glm file)
Open switch: SS_713 (using switch name of .glm file)
Close: 20 - 34 (in original topology), 20 - 34 (in simplified topology)
Close: node725 - node741 (using node names of .glm file)
Close switch: TS_725-741 (using switch name of .glm file)
