Case name: IEEE37/IEEE_37node.
Fault section: 56 - 20 (in original topology), 7 - 20 (in simplified topology)
Fault section: node725s - node725 (using node names of .glm file)
"Fault" switch: SS_725 (using switch name of .glm file)
Full restoration is successful.
The optimal switching sequence is as follows. 
Open: 56 - 20 (in original topology), 7 - 20 (in simplified topology)
Open: node725s - node725 (using node names of .glm file)
Open switch: SS_725 (using switch name of .glm file)
Close: 20 - 34 (in original topology), 20 - 34 (in simplified topology)
Close: node725 - node741 (using node names of .glm file)
Close switch: TS_725-741 (using switch name of .glm file)
