Case name: IEEE37/IEEE_37node.
Fault section: 57 - 21 (in original topology), 4 - 21 (in simplified topology)
Fault section: node727s - node727 (using node names of .glm file)
"Fault" switch: SS_727 (using switch name of .glm file)
Full restoration is successful.
The optimal switching sequence is as follows. 
Open: 57 - 21 (in original topology), 4 - 21 (in simplified topology)
Open: node727s - node727 (using node names of .glm file)
Open switch: SS_727 (using switch name of .glm file)
Close: 35 - 23 (in original topology), 35 - 23 (in simplified topology)
Close: node742 - node729 (using node names of .glm file)
Close switch: TS_742-729 (using switch name of .glm file)
