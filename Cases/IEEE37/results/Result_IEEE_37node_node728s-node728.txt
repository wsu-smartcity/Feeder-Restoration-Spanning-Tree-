Case name: IEEE37/IEEE_37node.
Fault section: 58 - 22 (in original topology), 36 - 22 (in simplified topology)
Fault section: node728s - node728 (using node names of .glm file)
"Fault" switch: SS_728 (using switch name of .glm file)
Full restoration is successful.
The optimal switching sequence is as follows. 
Open: 58 - 22 (in original topology), 36 - 22 (in simplified topology)
