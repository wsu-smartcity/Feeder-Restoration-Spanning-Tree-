Case name: IEEE37/IEEE_37node.
Fault section: 63 - 27 (in original topology), 9 - 27 (in simplified topology)
Fault section: node733s - node733 (using node names of .glm file)
"Fault" switch: SS_733 (using switch name of .glm file)
Full restoration is successful.
The optimal switching sequence is as follows. 
Open: 63 - 27 (in original topology), 9 - 27 (in simplified topology)
Open: node733s - node733 (using node names of .glm file)
Open switch: SS_733 (using switch name of .glm file)
Close: 22 - 29 (in original topology), 22 - 29 (in simplified topology)
Close: node728 - node735 (using node names of .glm file)
Close switch: TS_728-735 (using switch name of .glm file)
