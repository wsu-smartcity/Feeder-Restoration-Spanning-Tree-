Case name: IEEE37/IEEE_37node.
Fault section: 65 - 29 (in original topology), 11 - 29 (in simplified topology)
Fault section: node735s - node735 (using node names of .glm file)
"Fault" switch: SS_735 (using switch name of .glm file)
Full restoration is successful.
The optimal switching sequence is as follows. 
Open: 65 - 29 (in original topology), 11 - 29 (in simplified topology)
Open: node735s - node735 (using node names of .glm file)
Open switch: SS_735 (using switch name of .glm file)
Close: 22 - 29 (in original topology), 22 - 29 (in simplified topology)
Close: node728 - node735 (using node names of .glm file)
Close switch: TS_728-735 (using switch name of .glm file)
