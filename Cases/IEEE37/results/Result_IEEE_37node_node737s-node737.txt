Case name: IEEE37/IEEE_37node.
Fault section: 67 - 31 (in original topology), 28 - 31 (in simplified topology)
Fault section: node737s - node737 (using node names of .glm file)
"Fault" switch: SS_737 (using switch name of .glm file)
Full restoration is successful.
The optimal switching sequence is as follows.
