Case name: IEEE37/IEEE_37node.
Fault section: 68 - 32 (in original topology), 31 - 32 (in simplified topology)
Fault section: node738s - node738 (using node names of .glm file)
"Fault" switch: SS_738 (using switch name of .glm file)
Full restoration is successful.
The optimal switching sequence is as follows. 
Open: 68 - 32 (in original topology), 31 - 32 (in simplified topology)
